# Library-database-with-form
My education practice

This is a project for completing my training practice. 
This repository contains a script file that will automatically design the library database. 
There is also the project itself. It is written in C# using Windows Forms. 
This software product provides interaction with the library's subject area. 
Any "user" can register in this program and order any book from the library. 
The program also allows you to be a library administrator. 
Administrator password: "15СмысловАА!"
The administrator can change all the database tables and also monitor the return of books;)
